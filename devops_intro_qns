1. what is SDLC?and how it runs?
ans:-SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured process used in software engineering to design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software. 
    The SDLC consists of a set of phases or stages through which a software product evolves, from the initial idea to its deployment and maintenance. 
    These phases ensure that software development is systematic, well-planned, and results in a product that meets the specified requirements.

    The typical stages of SDLC are as follows:-

1)Requirements :
In this phase, project requirements are gathered from stakeholders and analyzed to determine their feasibility, understand the scope of the project, and define system goals.

2)System Design:
In this phase, the system architecture and design are created based on the requirements gathered. This includes designing the software components, databases, and user interfaces.

3) Coding:
During this phase, developers write the code based on the design specifications. The programming languages, frameworks, and tools specified in the design phase are used to create
the software.

4)Testing:
The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix bugs, validate that it meets the specified requirements, and ensure its reliability, performance, and security.

5)Integration:
In this phase, different components or modules of the software are integrated to create a complete system.

2.what is waterfall methdology?
  ans:-The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential software development approach that divides the software development process into discrete phases.
    Each phase in the Waterfall Model must be completed before moving on to the next one, and the phases do not overlap. The output of one phase serves as
    the input for the next phase. The phases in the Waterfall Model typically include:
    Requirements Gathering and Analysis,System Design, Implementation (Coding),Testing,Deployment and Maintenance.

    The Waterfall Model is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements. However, it has been criticized
    for its lack of flexibility and adaptability, as it doesn't easily accommodate changes once a phase is completed. If significant changes are needed, it can be costly 
    and time-consuming to go back and revisit earlier phases.

    Modern software development methodologies, such as Agile, have gained popularity due to their iterative and more flexible nature, addressing some of the limitations 
    associated with the Waterfall Model. Agile methodologies allow for ongoing feedback and adjustments throughout the development process, promoting a more adaptive 
    and customer-centric approach.

3. what is agile methdology?
   ans:-Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer satisfaction. 
     It's a departure from traditional, sequential development approaches like Waterfall, focusing on delivering smaller, incremental releases of a product with each iteration.
     The Agile methodology values individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.

   Here are the key principles and characteristics of Agile methodology:

    1. **Iterative Development:**
       Agile projects are divided into small, manageable increments called iterations or sprints, usually lasting 2-4 weeks. Each iteration results in a potentially shippable 
       product increment.
   
    2. **Customer Involvement and Feedback:**
         Customers and stakeholders are involved throughout the development process, providing continuous feedback on each iteration. This ensures the product aligns with 
         customer needs and requirements.

    3. **Adaptability and Flexibility:**
         Agile teams are open to change and can adapt quickly to new requirements, priorities, or market conditions. The project's direction can be adjusted at 
        the end of each iteration.

    4. **Cross-Functional Teams:**
      Agile teams are self-organizing and cross-functional, meaning they have all the necessary skills to complete the work within an iteration. Team members collaborate 
        closely and share responsibilities.

    5. **Continuous Improvement:**
       Agile promotes a culture of continuous improvement through regular retrospectives. Teams reflect on their processes and outcomes, identifying ways to enhance 
      productivity, quality, and effectiveness.

    6. **Prioritization and Backlog:**
     The project backlog contains a prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes. The team works on the highest-priority items first, ensuring the most
       valuable elements are delivered early.

    7. **Transparency and Communication:**
     Agile emphasizes clear and open communication within the team and with stakeholders. Progress, impediments, and the product's state are visible and accessible 
       to everyone involved.

    8. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
       Development is driven by writing tests before writing the code. This ensures that the code meets the requirements and helps maintain code quality.

      Popular Agile frameworks and methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, Lean, Extreme Programming (XP), and more. Scrum, for instance, is widely used and defines
      specific roles, events, and artifacts to facilitate the iterative development process within fixed time frames (sprints).

      Overall, Agile methodologies aim to deliver value to customers faster and more effectively by responding quickly to changing requirements and market demands.

4)why do we choose agile methodology over the waterfallmethodology?
ans:-Choosing Agile methodology over the Waterfall methodology is a strategic decision that organizations often make based on
the specific needs and circumstances of their projects. Here are some reasons why Agile is often preferred over Waterfall:

1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Agile is highly flexible and adaptable to changing requirements, which is especially 
important in fast-paced and dynamic environments. It allows for adjustments and iterations based on feedback, ensuring the 
product meets evolving needs.

2. **Customer Involvement and Satisfaction**: Agile involves customers throughout the development process, seeking their feedback regularly.
This leads to higher customer satisfaction and a product that aligns better with customer expectations.

3. **Early and Incremental Value Delivery**: Agile emphasizes delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) early in the development process.
This provides stakeholders with a tangible product sooner and allows for early testing and validation.

4. **Iterative Progress and Feedback Loop**: Agile follows an iterative development approach, enabling frequent reviews and feedback loops.
